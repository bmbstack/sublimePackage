Comment / Uncomment
====================

Commenting is an important feature of almost every programming language. These
are the parts of the language that are targeting for a human and the compiler /
interpreter ignores them. Sublime Text provides a shortcut to mark lines as
comments.

For different programming languages comment construct could be different. e.g.
for `html` it is `<!-- comment -->` while for JavaScript it is `//` or `/* */`

* Toggle comments - `Cmd + /`

Exercise

As this file is written using markdown syntax, comments take the form of HTML
comments.

the toggle comments keyboard shortcut learned above to uncomment those lines.

  <li>third list item</li>
  </ul>
  <!--   <div>
