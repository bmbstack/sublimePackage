Split block of text selection into multiple lines
==================================================

If you need a cursor on each line in a region, then Sublime Text provides one
more way of doing it. Drag select a region of text, then press `Cmd + Shift + L`
This splits it into one selection per line.

Let's try this in practice by following the same exercise from the previous
units.

Exercise
---------

In the list given below add an asterisk followed by space (`* `) at the
beginning of each item. 

1. Drag select the whole block (from first item to the last one)
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + L`, this splits the selections into multiple lines.
3. Press left arrow key to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
4. Now type `* ` (asterisk followed by space) to complete the exercise.
