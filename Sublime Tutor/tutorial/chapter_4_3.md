Goto beginning of a line
==========================

This is one of the most frequently used commands, I would suggest you to master
it and put it in your muscle memory.

* Shortcut - `Ctrl + A / Cmd + left`

There are two shortcuts for this command. You can use anyone of them. I
personally like the first flavor more because both the keys in `Ctrl + A` are
easily in my reach while arrow keys tend to be slightly far.

Goto end of a line
===================

This is exact opposite of the command above. This also happens to be one of the
most frequently used commands.

* Shortcut - `Ctrl + E / Cmd + right`

As the case with `Goto beginning of a line` command, this command also has two
shortcuts, you are free to memorize any of them.
