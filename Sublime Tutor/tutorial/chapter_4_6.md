Code folding / unfolding
=========================

When you are working with nested code structures, you can see a folded view
of your code to get a larger picture.

* Fold one level - `Cmd + Option + [`
* Unfold code one level - `Cmd + Option + ]`

Exercise
---------

Let's try this with the following HTML code structure.

1. Put your cursor inside the `p` text somewhere.
2. Use the `Fold one level` shortcut `Cmd + Option + [`
3. While `Cmd` and `Option` keys are depressed, press `[` key multiple times
   so that whole code structure is completely folded.
4. Now use the shortcut for unfolding code `Cmd + Option + ]` until full code
   is visible.
