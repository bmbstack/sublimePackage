Delete word back / forward
===========================

* Delete the word backward - `Option + Delete`

If the cursor is in the middle of a word, it deletes the word from the cursor 
position to the beginning of this word. If the cursor is placed at the word 
beginning or whitespace, then it deletes the previous word.


* Delete the word forward - `fn + Option + Delete`

If the cursor is in the middle of a word, it deletes the word from the cursor 
position to the end of this word. If the cursor is placed at the word end or 
whitespace, then it deletes the next word.
