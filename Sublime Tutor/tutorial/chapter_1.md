Goto Anything (`Cmd + P`)
=======================

Give yourself a pat on the back. You just used your first keyboard shortcut.

This is probably the most frequently used command in Sublime Text. While a
project is open, you can use this command to move from one file to another,
search symbols defined in a file, go to a specific line number.

Let's give it another try. Follow the instructions below:

1. Press `Cmd + P`
2. This shows you Goto Anything panel. Typing name of a file should filter out
   names of files.
3. Type `c1rb` and press Return

Tip: You can also use `Cmd + T`, which also does the same thing. If you are
coming from a TextMate background, this would make you feel at home.
