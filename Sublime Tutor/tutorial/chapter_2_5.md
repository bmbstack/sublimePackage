Soft Undo / Redo
=================

Shortcuts for `undo` and `redo` commands are `Cmd + Z` and `Cmd + Shift + Z`
which is a standard on Mac. But here, we are talking about 'soft' undo and redo
actions.

Sublime has the ability to track your cursor position in the history. So, when
you move your cursor from one position to another, or select something, Sublime
can easily undo these 'soft' actions as well.

Shortcuts for soft undo and redo are:

* Soft undo - `Cmd + U`
* Soft redo - `Cmd + Shift + U`

Exercise
---------

Move your cursor using your mouse from one position to another, delete some
words, select some area, then again delete some words. Once you are done with
that, use soft undo with `Cmd + U` shortcut to delete all this. Then try redoing
it with `Cmd + Shift + U` and then undo that action again and come in the
original position.

Revision
---------

* Delete to beginning of the line - `Cmd + Delete`
* Delete to end of the line - `Ctrl + K`
* Delete word back - `Option + Delete`
* Delete a line - `Ctrl + Shift + K`
* Cut a line - `Cmd + X`
