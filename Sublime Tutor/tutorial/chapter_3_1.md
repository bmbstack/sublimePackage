Multiple cursors
===================

Sublime Text provides you a way put your cursor in multiple text blocks at the
same time. Use `Cmd` key with left mouse button and click at multiple places in
the document to put your cursor at all those places. Now, when you type 
something, the text is appended at all the cursor positions.

* Multiple cursors - `Cmd key with left mouse button`

Exercise
---------

In the list given below add an asterisk followed by space (`* `) in the 
beginning of each item. Use `Cmd + click` method for it. Keep `Cmd` key
pressed and click at the beginning of each list item to place your cursor there.
When it is done, type `* `

```

tab
caps lock
shift
control
command
option
space

```

Multiple selection
===================

Extending the same discussion around `multiple cursor`, you can extend this
trick to select text at multiple places. Press `Cmd` key and then drag select
multiple blocks of text in the document. Once you are in multiple selection
mode, you can also use the usual `Shift + (up|down|left|right)`
shortcuts to select blocks of text

Exercise
---------

In the list given below, drag select the items with `<==` marked on them.
Now delete them and replace with three tildas `~~~`

```

tab
caps lock <==
shift
control <==
command
option
space <==

```
