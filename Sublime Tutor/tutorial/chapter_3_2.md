Column Selection
=================

If you want to have multiple cursors in a column, then `Cmd + click`
could become cumbersome pretty soon. For this, there is a more convenient
method that Sublime Text provides.

* Column selection using mouse - `Option + click and drag`
* Keyboard shortcut - `Ctrl + Shift + up|down`

On the current version of Mac OSX, this keyboard shortcut is already bound to
mission control. In my case, I don't use mission control a lot, so I have
switched the key bindings for mission control off. If you also want to do the
same, go to `Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Mission Control` and
uncheck `Mission Control` shortcut. Alternatively, you could also change the
key-binding for column selection in Sublime Text to something else.

Exercise
---------

Following on from the exercise in unit 1, do the same thing again but this
time using column selection keyboard shortcut. In the list given below add an
asterisk followed by space (`* `) in the beginning of each item. Put your
cursor at the beginning of the word `tab`. Then press `Ctrl + Shift + down`.
This will put you into column selection mode, and keep selecting more rows on
column 1 as you keep pressing the `down` arrow key. Once the first column of
every item is selected, start typing `* ` (asterisk followed by space).
