Upper / lower case
===================

You can use two handy shortcuts to change the case any text block in Sublime.

* Lower case - `Cmd + K, Cmd + L`
* Upper case - `Cmd + K, Cmd + U`

That is, press `Cmd + K` directly followed by `Cmd + L` or `Cmd + U` to change
the case. In practice, you don't need to pull your finger from the `Cmd` key
while doing that. So, press `Cmd` with `K` and then lift your finger from `K` 
and press `U` to make an upper case transform.

Exercise
---------

Toggle the case of all the words given below. If the existing case is lower
then make it upper, if the existing case is upper, then make it lower.

```
