Find in project
================

If I had an option to keep only two shortcuts in Sublime Text, then I would
opt for `Goto anything` and `Find in project`. That is just to give you an
idea, how frequently you are going to use this shortcut.

This is equivalent to `grep` command of the shell world.

* Shortcut - `Cmd + Shift + F`

Let us search for some terms project wide and come back to this chapter then.

Exercise
---------

1. Press `Cmd + Shift + F` to open `Find in project` panel.
2. In the `Find` field type `class Foo` and press Return.
   (Quick tip here: `Cmd + E` and `Cmd + Shift + E` for add select to find /
   replace shortcuts work here as well)
3. You get a list of matched terms in a new tab. If found, the search term
   will be highlighted. Double clicking on a line with highlighted search term
   will automatically open the file and take us to the corresponding line
   number.
4. Try this will 4-5 different search terms and make yourself comfortable with
   this command.
5. When you done playing around with this, move to next module.
